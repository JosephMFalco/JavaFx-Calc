Hello, This is a GUI Calculator I made that attempts to replicate anyother calculator app. 
I made this program with little help and am happy with how it turned out. 

The calculator is equipped with numbers 0-9, addition, subtraction, mulitiplication, and division.
It is also possible to create negative numbers and decimals.

The calculator is accurate as far as I know.
There is a custom exception that handles any invalid expression and throws an ERROR where the answer would be.

The program utilizes javafx in order to create the GUI.

To use this program you must first download all files and ensure Javafx is downloaded.
Because I do not know how to make applications this must be run in a IDE.
Once everything is downloaded, use the CalcLauncher to run it.
